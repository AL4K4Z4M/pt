### Section 1: Bug Reports & Fixes ###

- **Inconsistent Password Visibility:** The main login/register modal lacks a "Show Password" toggle, while the admin panel now has one. This should be consistent.
- **Stale Admin Status:** A user's `isAdmin` status is stored in localStorage and might not update if their privileges are revoked on the backend until they log out and back in. This could be a security risk. Frontend should re-validate admin status on sensitive actions.
- **Admin Stats Not Filtering:** The statistics cards at the top of the admin dashboard show global totals and do not update to reflect the currently active filter.
- **Invalid Vehicle Model:** In the "Manage User" modal, if an admin changes a user's vehicle make, the model dropdown updates, but an invalid previous model can still be saved. The model selection should be cleared or validated when the make changes.
- **Basic Profanity Filter:** The `forbiddenWords` list is a good start but can be easily bypassed with character substitutions (e.g., `b@dword`). A more robust filtering mechanism should be considered.
- **Generic API Error Handling:** Frontend error messages for API failures are often generic. They should be made more user-friendly and specific where possible.


### Section 2: Suggested Ideas for Improvements ###

- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for the main review feed on the home page and for all tables in the admin dashboard to improve performance as data grows.
- **Admin "Clear Filter" Button:** Add a button to the admin panel to easily clear the current user filter and show all records again.
- **New Badge Notifications:** When a user earns a new badge, display a non-intrusive "toast" notification to celebrate the achievement in real-time.
- **User Reporting System:** Add a "Report" button to reviews. This would flag the review for admin attention and could include reasons like "Spam," "Inappropriate Content," or "False Information." This requires a new admin view to manage reported content.
- **Custom Avatars:** Allow users to upload their own profile picture/avatar instead of the default SVG icon.
- **Clickable Admin Links:** In the admin dashboard tables, make user IDs/usernames clickable links that open that user's profile on the main site in a new tab.
- **Comment Flexibility:** While the comment builder is unique, consider allowing users to write a free-text comment as an alternative. This would be passed through a profanity filter.


### Section 3: Major Improvement Ideas ###

- **Gamification & Leaderboard:** Overhaul the engagement system by introducing points. Users could earn points for submitting reviews, receiving upvotes, and earning badges. A public leaderboard could rank users by points, creating a competitive incentive.
- **Social & Following System:** Allow users to "follow" other users. This would enable a new "Following" feed on the home page, creating a more personalized and social experience.
- **Full Notifications System:** Implement a comprehensive in-app notification center (e.g., a bell icon in the header). This would alert users to events like "Your review received an upvote," "You've unlocked the 'Road Warrior' badge," or "UserX is now following you." Could also include email notification preferences.
- **Corporate Fleet Management:** Create a new account type for businesses ("Fleet Accounts"). This would be a premium/paid feature allowing companies to register all their vehicle license plates and monitor the public's feedback on their drivers and fleet.
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** Provide a personal dashboard for logged-in users showing their own statistics, such as their average rating given, a map of their review locations, and their most frequently used traits.
- **Public API:** Develop a read-only public API that allows third-party services to query a license plate and retrieve its average rating and the number of reviews. This could be rate-limited and potentially monetized.
- **Location-Aware Submissions:** With user permission, use browser geolocation to automatically suggest the correct "Incident State" when a user is submitting a new review, reducing friction.
