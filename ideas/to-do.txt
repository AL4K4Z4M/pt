I want to change positive and negative traits in my code to these instead
I need to change all the code referencing the old traits and replace them with these


const veryGoodTraits = [
  "Alert & Aware",
  "Big Dick Energy",
  "Defensive Driving",
  "Patient with Pedestrians"
];

const goodTraits = [
  "Allowed Merge",
  "Excellent Parking",
  "Followed Signs",
  "Kept Right to Pass",
  "Proper Speed",
  "Respectful Distance",
  "Smooth Braking",
  "Stopped Fully",
  "Used Turn Signals",
  "Yielded Correctly"
];

const badTraits = [
  "Blocking Traffic",
  "Driving Too Slow",
  "Excessive Honking",
  "Ignoring Signs",
  "Improper U-Turn",
  "Lane Weaving",
  "No Turn Signals",
  "Poor Parking",
  "Rolling Stops",
  "Speeding",
  "Sudden Braking"
];

const veryBadTraits = [
  "Aggressive Driving",
  "Brake Checking",
  "Cut Off Others",
  "Distracted Driving",
  "Road Rage",
  "Running Red Light",
  "Small Dick Energy",
